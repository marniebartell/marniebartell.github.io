    <h3 class="mb-4">Hello! I'm Marnie...</h3>
	<p>I am a user experience (UX) advisor with over 25 years of creating, managing, and leading web design, strategy, and front-end development.</p>
	<p>My greatest strength is creative problem-solving and I have a talent for seeing possibilities and challenging the status quo. I am passionate about making technology easier for people to use, and I value figuring things out and getting things done.</p>
	<p>I am known for combining technology and design to help people get the information they need. I spent the early years of my career helping people get onto the Internet and the last 20 years helping people get health information.</p>
	<p>For much of my career, I have worked independently within large organizations with my bosses and teams often being located in different cities. I am self-directed and self-motivated, as a result, but work very well on teams and am great at building relationships, even remotely.</p>
	<p>I have worked with notable clients including various Alberta Health Services teams, Alberta Health, Health Link Alberta, Inform Alberta, OpenText, Microsoft, and Disney.</p>
	<p>I love camping, music, cross-country skiing, cycling, hiking, and being outside. I spend time drawing, doodling, and journaling as a creative outlet (and to relax). I love spending time with my family, including twins sons and two dachshunds.</a>
